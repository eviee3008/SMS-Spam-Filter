# SMS-Spam-Filter

## Overview

This repository contains the development of a spam filter using Python. The spam filter is designed to classify new SMS messages as either spam or non-spam (ham) based on a training dataset of existing SMS messages labelled as spam or ham. Please read through the notebook for further explanation.

The initial challenges and dataset were provided by DataCamp, but as explained in the notebook, the code is my own work.
